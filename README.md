# Build Your Own Vision Library! #

In this repository you will find instructions on how to build your own image processing/computer vision library from (mostly) scratch. The work is divided out into different homework assignments, found in the `src/` directory.

To get started, make sure you have `git`, a C compiler, and `make` installed. Then run:

    git clone https://github.com/utama133/If6083ComputerVision.git
    cd If6083ComputerVision
    make

and check to see that everything compiles correctly. 
Then, to get started, open the link below!
Good luck and have fun!
